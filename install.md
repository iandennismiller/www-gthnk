## Typical Users

We recommend that most users try the [Installation Wizard](/wizards/install) for a guided installation process.

<a class="button" href="/wizards/install/">Installation Wizard</a>

## Advanced Users

The installation process is described in detail [in the documentation](http://gthnk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/installation.html). Advanced Python users might find this faster.
