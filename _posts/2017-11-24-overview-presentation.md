title: Presenting an Overview of Gthnk
---

The new [Gthnk Overview Presentation](http://iandennismiller.github.io/pres-gthnk-overview) is a slide deck that explains how to get started using Gthnk.

The goal for this presentation is to introduce Gthnk to new audiences.
In the span of about 15 minutes, somebody should learn what Gthnk is, the kinds of problems it can solve, and how to install it on their own computer.
To put it another way, the presentation should give anybody who sees it all the information they need to get started using Gthnk.

This presentation is going to be used at local events to introduce Gthnk to new communities.
A screencast is also going to be created from this presentation.
If you have feedback on the presentation, please [create an issue about it here](https://www.github.com/iandennismiller/pres-gthnk-overview/issues).
