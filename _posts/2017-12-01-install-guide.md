The website has a new feature called the Install Guide that helps new users get started with Gthnk.

Good communication might be the most important part of an open source project.

This is a pretty complicated installation process requiring intermediate computer skills to complete.
The instructions are pretty concrete but they do not provide a visually-complete guide that a novice could follow.
Some steps involve implied sub-steps (e.g. downloading and installing Python), so intermediate skills are required.
However, that is potentially millions of users.

To bring this software to as many people as possible, we need to reduce barriers to installation.
The technical barriers inherent in installation are pretty high, so this already eliminates a whole swathe of users.
