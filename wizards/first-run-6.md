Here's what you can expect Gthnk to do.

1. You keep adding new entries to your journal as you work.
2. Gthnk is always running so you can search your old notes.
3. After midnight every day, `journal.txt` will be rotated to start a new day.
4. At 9am, Gthnk will launch a browser window so you can review yesterday's notes.

There are many ways to integrate Gthnk with your system so Gthnk becomes quick and easy to use.
For example, text editors can type the date and time for you.
Advanced topics these are discussed in the documentation.
